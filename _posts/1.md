# throttle

``` tip
Returns a function, that, when invoked, will only be triggered at most once during a given window of time. Normally, the throttled function will run as much as it can, without ever going more than once per `wait` duration; but if you'd like to disable the execution on the leading edge, pass `{leading: false}`. To disable execution on the trailing edge, ditto.

返回一个函数，在调用时，它只在给定的时间窗口中最多触发一次。通常，节流函数将尽可能多地运行，但每次“等待”持续时间不超过一次
如果你想禁止立即执行一次 {leading:false}
